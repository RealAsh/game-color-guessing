        const COLORS_ARRAY = ['blue', 'cyan', 'gold', 'gray', 'green', 'magenta', 'orange', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'];

Uncomment this alert if you want to check what value 'targetIndex' has been set to (and thus whether it is changing at random as intedned and also a number that is viable to be present in the given array) via an alert in the browser
